Hello sir,
            I have provided first pass of Assembler in this submission.
            Following are the files included:
            1. passOne.py:
                This file contains source code of First Pass of the assembler.
                I have created symbol table, literal table and generated intermediate code in this program.'
                This program takes input file 'search_string.asm' as input assembly program.
            2. search_string.asm:
                This is input file consisting of assembly code to be parsed by my first pass assembler.
